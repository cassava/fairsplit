Fairsplit
=========

Fairsplit is a program that helps you to split expenses fairly among a group
of people.

It works by assuming that when a person spends money, he is spending for
himself and for other people. For example,

    Ben 45.00 Reed Sonia

means that Ben spent 45.00 of whatever currency for himself as well as Reed
and Sonia. It is only fair then, if Reed and Sonia each take a third of the
costs, which means that Reed and Sonia each should pay Ben 15.00 of the same
currency.
